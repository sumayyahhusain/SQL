-- In this SQL project, I'm querying a database with multiple table sin it to understand and quantify order and customer data.

-- How many unique orders were placed in January (distinct orders ids)?

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order Id';

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January (number of products sold and price of the product)?
SELECT Product, ROUND(sum(quantity)*price, 2) AS totalRevenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, Price, SUM(Quantity)*price AS totalSpent
FROM FebSales

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
